# Macroquad Canvas

# Notice

This is a hard fork of the original
[macroquad-canvas-2d](https://git.sr.ht/~nik_codes/macroquad-canvas); the only thing that I didn't
touch is the math involving aligning the canvas, everything else was changed.

## Description

**macroquad-canvas** is a simple resolution-handling library for
[Macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) that allows you to focus on making your games with
fixed resolution. If you're making a pixel game, then this library is for you!

# How To Use

**macroquad-canvas** is easy to use and setup, the only thing you'll need to import is `Canvas2D`.

```rust
use macroquad_canvas::Canvas2D;
```

Then simply create the canvas

```rust
let canvas = Canvas2D::new(800_f32, 600_f32);
```

And here's how to draw the canvas

```rust
loop {
    set_camera(&canvas.camera);

    // Draw inside canvas...

    set_default_camera();

    canvas.draw();

    next_frame().await
}
```

That's all you need to know to get started! For more examples, check out the
[examples](https://github.com/alexmozaidze/macroquad-canvas/tree/main/examples) folder.
